# Node & React fullstack development project

## Section 1: Course content

On this section, we will target all the information to begin to work and learn all the topics of the course

### Adding prettier

As a recommendation, we add `prettier` to work on the course so `prettier` will help us to automatically format our `js` files to follow guidelines that are pre-determined by its configuration.

#### Step to add prettier on vs code

- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Create a `package.json` file using `npm init` command
- Install as a `dev` dependency the `prettier` package using `npm install --save-dev prettier`
- Create a `.prettierrc` file on your root directory
- Add `{}` on your `.prettierrc` to get a basic configuration
- Go to the `code` section in `vs code`
- Go to the `setting` option
- Find the `format on save` option and check it
- Find the `Prettier:Require config` option and check it

### App specification

On this section we got a breif introduction of the app that we gonna build and here are some specifications:

- Someone uses startup owner's app/service
- Startup owner wants feedback
- Send customer an email requesting feedback
- Get tabulation of results
- Make app/service better with feedback!
